# Student Academic Performance Prediction

## 1. Overview

This project uses classical machine learning techniques to predict the final academic performance of students based on a range of demographic, social, and school-related attributes. The goal is to identify key factors that influence student success and create a model that can flag at-risk students early on.

## 2. Problem Statement

Identifying students who are at risk of poor academic performance is crucial for educational institutions. Early intervention can provide these students with the necessary support to succeed. This project aims to build a predictive model that uses readily available student data to forecast final grades, thereby enabling educators to take proactive measures.

## 3. Dataset

The model was developed using the **Student Performance Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* **Source:** [UCI Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)
* **Content:** The dataset contains data from two Portuguese schools. The attributes include student grades, demographic features (e.g., age, sex), social factors (e.g., family life, free time, alcohol consumption), and school-related information (e.g., study time, failures).
* **Target Variable:** The final grade, `G3`, is the target variable for prediction.

## 4. Methodology

This project follows a standard machine learning workflow for a regression/classification task.

#### a. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyzed the distribution of different variables.
* Used visualizations (histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps) to understand the relationships between features and the final grade.
* Identified key features that are highly correlated with student performance.

#### b. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
* **Handling Categorical Data:** Converted categorical features (e.g., `school`, `sex`, `address`) into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.
* **Feature Selection:** Selected the most relevant features based on EDA findings and correlation analysis to reduce model complexity and improve performance.
* **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

#### c. Model Selection & Training
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
* **Linear Regression:** As a baseline model.
* **Random Forest Regressor:** An ensemble model known for its high accuracy and ability to handle complex interactions.
* **Gradient Boosting Regressor (e.g., XGBoost):** Another powerful ensemble method often providing state-of-the-art results on tabular data.

The models were trained on the training set to predict the final grade `G3`.

## 5. Hypothetical Results

The models' performance would be evaluated using standard regression metrics.

* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** To measure the average magnitude of the prediction errors.
* **R-squared (R²):** To determine the proportion of the variance in the final grade that is predictable from the features.
* **Feature Importance:** For tree-based models like Random Forest, a feature importance plot would be generated to highlight the most influential factors (e.g., past failures, study time, mother's education).

*(Note: A good model for this dataset typically achieves an R² score between 0.80 and 0.90 on the test set.)*
